RSA can only encrypt data blocks that are shorter than the key length so what you normally do is:

Generate a random key of the correct length required for AES (or similar).
Encrypt your data using AES or similar using that key
Encrypt the random key using your RSA key
Then you publish both the outputs from 2 and 3

To decrypt

Decrypt the AES key using your RSA key.
Decrypt the data using that AES key
